## Solution Brief

The provided code outlines a comprehensive solution for processing and storing vehicle data using Azure services. It includes extracting the latest image from an Azure Blob Storage container, using Azure Cognitive Services to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on the image for license plate and state recognition, and subsequently fetching detailed vehicle information using a vehicle registration API. This information is then parsed and stored in an Azure Table Storage. The solution showcases integration across multiple Azure services, including Blob Storage, Cognitive Services, and Table Storage, demonstrating a robust approach to handling and analyzing vehicle data in real-time.
